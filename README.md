Email Spam Detector

This Email Spam Detector is built using Python and Flask, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with TF-IDF vectorization to transform email/SMS text into numerical features. The classification is performed using Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm for binary classification. The model is trained on labeled datasets of spam and ham messages to accurately classify incoming messages. The Flask web interface allows users to input messages and receive real-time spam detection results, making it a useful tool for filtering unwanted emails and improving communication security. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to address the real-world problem of spam detection efficiently and effectively.

Tech Stack
